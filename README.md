# Potflower-Stock-Management
This project is a desktop application to keep track of potflowers management. The app is made in JavaFX and is connected to a trivial database from my computer in MySql Workbench.  To make it work on your computer just change the configuration of the database connection from the DBConnection package. The GUI is made using SceneBuilder and the java code is written in Eclipse IDE. The app has 4 services: add, update, delete, and search for a product. Each product has an ID, name, height, width, weight, the number of pieces available, and a price. The products are shown in a table on the main page.
